# Domain Transition Detection

Detect and visulize the domain changes occur around SIGIR conference

## Algorithm Explaination

The final goal of this algorithm is to compute the 2D embedding of the papers points around SIGIR conference. To accomplish this, we first need to construct a reference graph $G(V,\ E)$ and use largeVis to compute its embedding.

The current algorithm start with finding all the
